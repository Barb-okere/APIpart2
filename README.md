E-commerce Models - Django Project
This project defines three core models for an e-commerce system using Django: Customer, Order, and OrderItem.

Setting Up the Environment
Install Python and Django:
Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later) and pip (package manager) installed on your system. You can download them from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Create Virtual Environment (Optional):
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Use venv or virtualenv depending on your Python version:
Bash
python -m venv venv  # Using venv
Use code with caution.

Activate the virtual environment:
Bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
Use code with caution.

Install Django:
Install Django using pip inside the virtual environment:
Bash
pip install django
Use code with caution.

Running the Project
Create a Django Project:
Navigate to your desired project directory and run:
Bash
django-admin startproject ecommerce_models
Use code with caution.

Create App (models.py is located here):
Inside the ecommerce_models directory, create an app for your models:
Bash
cd ecommerce_models
django-admin startapp models
Use code with caution.

Copy Models:
Copy the provided models.py file to the models app directory.
Register Models (settings.py):
Open ecommerce_models/settings.py and add your app to INSTALLED_APPS:
Python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps
    'models',
]
Use code with caution.

Migrate (Create Tables):
Run database migrations to create tables based on your models:
Bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Use code with caution.

Run Development Server:
Start the Django development server:
Bash
python manage.py runserver
Use code with caution.

Access the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to view and interact with your models.
Uploading Project to GitHub
Create a GitHub Repository:
Create a new repository on your GitHub account.
Initialize Git:
Open a terminal in your project directory and initialize a Git repository:
Bash
git init
Use code with caution.

Link to Remote Repository:
Set up the remote repository URL pointing to your GitHub repository:
Bash
git remote add origin <your_github_repo_url>
Use code with caution.

Replace <your_github_repo_url> with the actual URL of your repository.
Push to GitHub:
Push your committed code to the remote repository:
Bash
git push origin main
Use code with caution.

Note: This assumes you have configured SSH keys for secure connection with GitHub. Refer to GitHub's documentation for alternative authentication methods.

This README provides a basic guide to setting up and running the Django project with the provided models. You can further explore Django documentation for creating more advanced features and functionalities.
